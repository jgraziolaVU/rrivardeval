# This file is no longer needed!
# 
# The Course Evaluation Summarizer now uses user-provided API keys
# instead of environment variables. Users enter their own Anthropic
# API key directly in the application interface.
#
# To get an Anthropic API key, visit: https://console.anthropic.com/
#
# This approach provides:
# - Better security (no shared API keys)
# - User control over costs
# - No server-side key management needed
